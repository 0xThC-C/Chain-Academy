# Satisfaction Survey Navigation & Alert Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve navigation issues in the satisfaction survey flow and replace browser alerts with custom modal components.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Navigation Issues
- **Problem**: When users closed the survey (without submitting), navigation to home page was inconsistent
- **Problem**: When users submitted the survey successfully, navigation to home page was inconsistent
- **Solution**: Implemented consistent navigation to home page (`/`) using `safeCleanupAndNavigate()` utility in all survey completion scenarios

### 2. Browser Alert Replacement
- **Problem**: All `window.alert()` and `window.confirm()` calls provided poor UX and inconsistent styling
- **Solution**: Created custom `AlertModal` component and replaced all browser dialogs

## Files Modified

### 1. New Component Created
- `/src/components/AlertModal.tsx` - Custom alert modal component with success, error, warning, and info variants

### 2. Components Updated

#### `/src/components/SatisfactionSurvey.tsx`
- Replaced `alert()` calls with custom `AlertModal`
- Added alert state management
- Improved user feedback with typed alerts (warning for validation, error for failures)

#### `/src/components/SessionRoom.tsx`
- Replaced `alert()` in `handleSurveySubmit` with custom `AlertModal`
- Fixed navigation to home page after survey submission
- Fixed navigation to home page after survey close (without submission)
- Added success alert with auto-navigation after 2 seconds

#### `/src/pages/FeedbackPage.tsx`
- Replaced `window.alert()` and `window.confirm()` with custom modals
- Added `ConfirmationModal` for survey close confirmation
- Added `AlertModal` for success/error messages
- Fixed navigation to home page in all scenarios
- Added success alert with auto-navigation after 2 seconds

#### `/src/components/NotificationMenu.tsx`
- Replaced `alert()` calls with custom `AlertModal`
- Replaced `window.confirm()` with custom `ConfirmationModal`
- Added proper modal state management
- Improved feedback flow with auto-closing success alerts

## Navigation Flow Fixed

### Scenario 1: User Submits Survey Successfully
1. User completes and submits survey
2. Success alert shows: "Obrigado pelo seu feedback! O pagamento foi liberado para o mentor."
3. After 2 seconds, alert auto-closes and user is navigated to home page (`/`)
4. Notification is removed from pending list

### Scenario 2: User Closes Survey Without Submitting
1. User clicks close/cancel on survey
2. Confirmation modal appears: "Exit Without Feedback?"
3. If user confirms exit:
   - Survey closes
   - User is navigated to home page (`/`)
   - Notification remains in pending list for later completion
4. If user cancels: survey remains open

### Scenario 3: User Dismisses Notification
1. User clicks X on notification in dropdown
2. Confirmation modal appears: "Descartar Notificação?"
3. If confirmed: notification is removed from list
4. If cancelled: notification remains

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistent Navigation**: All survey interactions now properly navigate to home page
2. **Better UX**: Custom modals match the app's design theme (dark/light mode support)
3. **Clear Feedback**: Users receive proper success/error messages
4. **No Lost Data**: Notifications are properly managed (completed surveys remove notifications, cancelled surveys keep them)
5. **Responsive Design**: Custom modals work well on mobile and desktop
6. **Accessibility**: Custom modals support ESC key and proper focus management

## Testing Scenarios

To test the fixes:

1. **Complete Survey Flow**:
   - Start a session as a student
   - Leave session to trigger survey
   - Complete survey → Should show success message and navigate to home

2. **Cancel Survey Flow**:
   - Start a session as a student  
   - Leave session to trigger survey
   - Close survey without completing → Should confirm and navigate to home
   - Check notifications → Should still show pending feedback

3. **Notification Survey Flow**:
   - Click on pending notification in bell menu
   - Complete survey → Should show success and close all modals
   - OR close survey → Should confirm and keep notification

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Try to submit survey without rating → Should show validation warning
   - Try to submit without confirmation → Should show validation warning

## Code Quality Improvements

- Removed all `window.alert()` and `window.confirm()` dependencies
- Added proper TypeScript typing for modal states
- Implemented consistent error handling patterns
- Added proper cleanup and navigation utilities usage
- Improved component reusability with shared AlertModal component

All survey flows now provide a consistent, professional user experience with proper navigation to the home page after completion.
