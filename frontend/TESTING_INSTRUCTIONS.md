# Testing Instructions - Session Room Improvements

## Implemented Features

### 1. Fixed Screen Flickering Issue
- **Problem**: The SessionRoom component was re-initializing multiple times causing screen flickering
- **Solution**: Added initialization guards using `useRef` and `hasJoinedRoom` state to prevent multiple initialization attempts
- **Test**: Navigate to `/dashboard` > "My Mentorships" tab > Click "Join Session" - should load smoothly without flickering

### 2. Automatic Camera/Microphone Access Request
- **Feature**: Automatically requests camera and microphone permissions when joining a session
- **Implementation**: Enhanced getUserMedia call with detailed constraints and user-friendly error handling
- **Test**: When clicking "Join Session", browser should immediately prompt for camera/microphone access

### 3. Satisfaction Survey for Students
- **Feature**: Students see a satisfaction survey popup when leaving a session
- **Implementation**: Modal popup with rating system, feedback text, and payment confirmation
- **Test**: Join a session and click "Leave Session" - survey popup should appear
